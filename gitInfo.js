/*
    For this section of the assessment you will be putting together a cheat sheet for common git commands.  
    You'll provide the command as well as what it does. 
*/

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitDefinition'.
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what Git is.
*/

//CODE HERE

const gitDefinition = "Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. In Laman's terms, it's a library that contains a software developer's portfolio to reference later & back up his/her work to."


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitHubDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what GitHub is.
*/

//CODE HERE
const gitHubDefinition = "GitHub, Inc. is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git, plus its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project. Headquartered in California, it has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018."


//////////////////PROBLEM 3////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitInitDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git init' does.
*/

//CODE HERE
const gitInitDefinition = "The git init command creates a new Git repository. It can be used to convert an existing, unversioned project to a Git repository or initialize a new, empty repository. Most other Git commands are not available outside of an initialized repository, so this is usually the first command you'll run in a new project."


//////////////////PROBLEM 4////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitCloneDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git clone' does.
*/

//CODE HERE
const gitCloneDefinition = "Git receives a full copy of nearly all data that the server has. Every version of every file for the history of the project is pulled down by default when you run git clone. In fact, if your server disk gets corrupted, you can often use nearly any of the clones on any client to set the server back to the state it was in when it was cloned (you may lose some server-side hooks and such, but all the versioned data would be there"


//////////////////PROBLEM 5////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitStatusDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git status' does.
*/

//CODE HERE
const gitStatusDefinition = "The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git."


//////////////////PROBLEM 6////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitAddDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git add' does.

    Create another variable called 'gitAddCode'.  
    It should be a string containing the code to add all files.
*/

//CODE HERE
const gitAddDefinition = "The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. It tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit. However, git add doesn't really affect the repository in any significant way"

const gitAddCode = "git add ."

//////////////////PROBLEM 7////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitCommitDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git commit' does.

    Create a variable called 'gitCommitCode'.  
    It should be a string containing the code to commit using the message "initial commit".
*/

//CODE HERE
const gitCommitDefinition = "The git commit command captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. Committed snapshots can be thought of as 'safe' versions of a project"
const gitCommitCode = `git commit -m "Initial commit" `

//////////////////PROBLEM 8////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitPushDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git push' does.
*/

//CODE HERE

const gitPushDefinition = "The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo."
